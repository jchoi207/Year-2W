## Lecture 1: Control Systems and Homeostasis
- Homeostatis: tendency of the body and systems towards a stable and constant internal environment. Regulation of variables to maintain stability.
- Control systems: processes that regulate physiological processes 
- Negative feedback loops: mechanisms that maintain homeostasis by countering deviations from a set point 
- Key components: sensors, receptors, integrators, effectors and communication pathways

### Questions: 

1. **Define Homeostasis:** What is homeostasis and why is it important for living organisms?
- Homeostasis is the desire for a body and its subsystems to maintain a constant internal environment. Important as certain conditions are optimal for the body's functioning. 

2. **Components of Control Systems:** Can you identify and describe the roles of the key components in a physiological control system?
- Set point, Control integration center (usually the brain), efferent signal towards the effector, which is the muscle, gland etc that provides the physiological response. the sensor senses the change in its envrionment and relays the afferent signal towards the control integration center. 

3. **Negative Feedback Example:** Provide an example of a negative feedback loop in the human body. How does this loop help maintain homeostasis?
- temperature control: negative feedback E = 38 - T. same thing. 

4. **Comparison of Feedback Mechanisms:** How does negative feedback differ from positive feedback in terms of their roles in physiological processes?
- Negative feedback resists changes from a set point, leading to a stable point, as required by homeostasis, whereas the positive feedback loop has no stability. 

5. **Effectors in Homeostasis:** How do effectors contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis? Provide an example involving temperature regulation.
- Effectors are the body part that gets stimulated, like a gland for example. when its too hot, the effector will release water through sweat to cool down the body. 

6. **Sensors and Receptors:** Explain the difference between sensors and receptors within a control system. Are they always distinct components?
- NA

7. **Challenges to Homeostasis:** What might happen if a component of a control system fails? Discuss the potential consequences on the body’s homeostasis.
- Could lead to a fever.

8. **Integrators’ Function:** What is the role of an integrator in a control system? How does it interact with other components?
- It integrates and controls the signals, so it receives the afferent signals from the sensor, processes the information and then sends it back through motor pathways (ventral) down to the effector.

- During transcription, a DNA strand is split, and RNA polymerase is able to read the DNA strand and pair it with its complementary RNA strand. 


4. **Translation Process:** How does translation differ from transcription in the central dogma of molecular biology?
- Translation takes place with mRNA and tRNA to form proteins for cellular functions, wheras transcription is the copying of DNA to form mRNA that can be used as a template for creating proteins. 

5. **Role of Ribosomes in Protein Synthesis:** What function do ribosomes serve in the process of translation?
- Ribosomes are needed during initiation, when the tRNA and start codon attach to the mRNA strand, the small ribosomal unit joins in, when it reaches the start anti codon on the mRNA, the large ribosomal unit joins in.

## Lecture 7: Membrane Potential
### Resting Potential of an ion: 
$$E_{ion} = 61 \log \left( \frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}} \right)$$

- For the potassium ion, we can calculate the resting potential as:
$$E_{K} = 61 \log \left( \frac{5}{140} \right) = -90 mV$$

### Membrane Potential 
- Note that the membrane potential is not equal to the resting potential of any single ion, but rather a combination of the resting potentials of all ions. 
- The typical resting membrane potential is -70 mV 
- To understand the direction of specific ion flow, we compare V and E for that ion. 
    - If -70 > E, the ion is pushed out of the cell
        - For K, E = -90 mV, to get V closer to E, the cell must be more negative, so K will flow out of the cell


    - If V < E, the ion will flow into the cell
        - For Na, E = 60 mV, to get V closer to E, the cell must be more positive, so Na will flow into the cell


## Lecture 8, 9: Action Potential and Synapses

- Action Potential:
    - Propagation region: Axon
    - Controlled 
    - Triggered through a membrane depolarization 
    - All or nothing 
    - Always excitatory in the pre-synaptic neuron

- Action potentials 
    - There is an initial stimulus, generated by a graded potential, if it is too small in ampltidue, the graded potential dies out when it reaches the Axon hillock; however, if it reaches a certain threshold potential, the voltage gated channels open 
    - The sodium channels open first, allowing sodium to flow into the cell, the membrane potential reaches a maximum 
    - The sodium chanenls close, and the potassium channels open, leading to a repolarization anad depolarization, eventually the potassium channels close and the cell returns to its resting state

- Absolute Refractory Period and Relative Refarctory Period: 
    - Absolute refractory is the period of time, in which the membrane potential is greater than the threshold 
        - In this period, there cannot be another action potential that is fired, no matter how large the stimulus 
    - Relative refractory period:
        - This is the period of time after the absolute period, until the cell reaches its resting state again. In this case, there can be another action potential that fires, but the stimulus must be larger than the initial one.

### Elelctrical synapse vs Chemical synapses: 
    - Electrical synapses: 
        - Direct commnuication between synapses

        1. Action potential reaches the synaptic end bulbs 
        2. Calcium gated channels open, allowing an influx of calcium ions
        3. Calcium ions bind to vesicles, which are small sacs within the bulb that contain neurotransmitters 
        4. The vesicles fuse with the membrane, releasing the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft
        5. The neurotransmitters bind to the ligand gated channels of the post-synaptic neuron, allowing an influx of extracellular sodium ions
        6. Glial cells remove the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft by reuptake or enzymatic degradation

6. **Graded Potentials vs. Action Potentials:** Differentiate between graded potentials and action potentials in terms of initiation, propagation, and function.
- Graded potentials occur when a ligand cgated channel opens and sodium is able to rush into the cell, this is localized around the ligand gated channel, the membrane potential may not depolraize that much outside of this region. These potentials can occur multiple at the same time, and can sum 
- They die off at the axon hillokc if they do not generate a highe enough voltage to open the voltage gates
- If a potential reaches teh axon hillock that is sufficeintly high (at some threshold level) then an action potential can occur, wherein voltage gated sodium channels open, allowing an influs of positive ions. 

7. **Propagation of Action Potentials:** Explain how action potentials are generated and propagated along an axon, particularly in relation to the sodium and potassium channels.
- Sodium first, then potassium, sodiumg closes, potassium too much (hyperpolairzation)

8. **Refractory Periods:** Define the absolute and relative refractory periods and their significance in the firing of action potentials.

10. **Neurotransmitter Release and Reception:** Describe the process of neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses, including the role of calcium ions and the steps leading to signal transmission to the post-synaptic neuron.
- AP comes down the synaptic cleft, opening voltage gated calciumi chanels, allowing for an influx of calcium ions, this leads to calcium ions binding to vesicles full of NT, which allows them to fuse to the membrane releaseing the NT the synaptic cleft.
- Glial cells then recycle the NT


## Lecture 11: Central Nervous System
### EPSP Excitatory PostSynaptic potential
- 
    - Potentials that depolarize and increase the likelihood of an action potential 
    1. Temporal summation: multiple EPSPs from the same synapse within a short period of time s.t. constructive interference occurs
    2. Spatial summation: multiple EPSPs from different synapses that constructively interfere with each other, creating an action potential
    We call the Grand Postsynaptic potential: the combination of all temporal and spatial summations

### IPSP: Inhibitory PostSynaptic potential
- 
    - Potentials that hyperpolarize and decreaes the likelihood of an action potential. These are used to modulate synaptic strength, filtering out sensory information, stopping excessive excitation that might lead to nerve damage
    1. Postynaptic inhibition: release of inhibitory neurotransmitters by the presynaptic neuron, which *directly* inhibits the depolarization of postynaptic neurons 
    2. Presynaptic inhibition: inhibitory neuro synapse connects to excitatory synapse, which indirectly inhibits the depolarization of postsynaptic neurons.
        - Inhibitory synapse releases NTs that bind to receptrs on the presynaptic neuron, closing calcium channels
        - Thus, the excitatory neuron releases less neurotransmitters

        - Proprioceptors: body position
        - Somatosensory: touch
        - Osmoreceptors: osmotic pressure
    - Thermoreceptors: temperature
    - Nocioreceptors: pain
    - Photoreceptors: light
    - Chemoceptors: chemical composition of blood 
- Note that not all neurons will look the same, some will be free, but others might be encapsulated in a structure that enhances their sensitivity to a specific stimulus

2. Intensity: frequency coding and number of activated receptors 
- The larger the receptor potential, the greater the frequency of action potentials

3. Location: receptive field and lateral inhibition 
- Receptive field: the more densely receptors are spaced, the smaller area of skin each monitors, so a small receptive fields means greater acuity
- Lateral inhibition: process when excited neurons reduces activity of its neighbours which amplifies the excited neuron's signal

4. Duration: 
- Phasic Receptors: adapt rapidly to stimulus, initial response occurs, but then diminishes 
- Tonic Receptors: adapt slowly, and continue to generate APs over duration of stimulus

### Withdrawal Reflex
- Thermoreceptors sense the heat, which sends a signa through an afferent pathway to the integrating sensor (spinal cord), the isgnal transmits through an excitatory and inhibitory interneuron. The different pathways go to their corresponding effectors (muscles). The excitatory pathway neuron interfaces with the bicep at a neuromusclar junctions, whereas the inhibitory pathway interfaces with the tricep. The bicep contracts, and the tricep relaxes, causing the arm to move away from the heat source.

### Neuromuscular Junction
- **Fascicle**: bundle of axons which form a nerve. Connective tissue wraps around an individual axon and a group of them to form a fasciicle 
- Motor end plate and innervation of skeletal muscle: 
    - Motor neuron itnerfaces to multiple muslce fibers
    - The motor unit is the neuron and all the fibers that it innvertaes 
    - AP in motor neuron triggers the release of ACh 
    - ACh leads to muslce fibers sliding across each other

3. **Receptive Fields and Acuity:** Explain the concept of receptive fields and how they relate to sensory acuity.
- Receptive field is the area that the sensors occupy on the skin. The more densely populated the sensors are, the smaller the area that each sensor has to occupy, thus there is more acuity. 


4. **Lateral Inhibition:** What is lateral inhibition and how does it enhance sensory perception?
- When neighbouring neurons are inhibited such that the signal is more concentrated and the impulse is amplitfied. Allows greater sensory perception

5. **Phasic vs. Tonic Receptors:** Compare phasic and tonic receptors in terms of how they respond to stimuli over time.

## Lecture 15: Skeletal Muscle Structure

### Skeleton 
Protects, provides structure, creates joints and allows for articulations (but does not actuate)
- Joint: connection bewteen two bones 
- Cartilage: Collagenous connective tissue, that absorbs shock and reduces friction
- Tendon: elsatin and collagenous connective tissue, connects muscle to bone, support sctuation 
- Ligament: connective tissue, connecting bone to bone, supporting actuation
 
### Types of Contractions
1. Muscle shortens as it contract (lifting action) 
2. Muscle lengthens under tension (lowering action)
3. Muscle generates force without changing length (holding a box without moving) 


### Types of Muscle
- Skeletal: voluntary, striated, attached to bones, controlled by somatic nervous system (conscious control)
- Smooth: involuntary, non-striated, found in walls of hollow organs, controlled by autonomic nervous system
- Cardiac: involuntary, straited, found in the heart only 

#### Skeletal Muscle Structure (EPFEM)
- Epiysium (outer): sheath of fibrous elastic tissue that surrounds muscle 
- Perimysium (inner): sheath of connective tissue surrounding fascicles 
- Fascicle: muscle sub-unit that is a bundle of muscle fibers
- Endomysium: wispy connective tissue sheath surrounding each muscle fiber
- Muscle fiber: long strated muscle cell (contractile, multinucleated)


#### Muscle Fiber Structure
- Muscle fiber is the cell 
- Sarcolemma: cell membrane of muscle fiber
- Myofibril: 
    - Basic rod-like organelle of a muscle fiber 
    - Made of sarcomeres which contain thikc and thin filaments
        - Actin (thin) 
        - Myosin (thick)

#### Structure of Myofibril
- Skeletal Muscle > Muscle Cell > Myofibril  
    - M-line: attachemnt point that aligns myosin filaments in sarcomere
    - Z-line: marks the boundary of a sarcomere
    - H-zone: region around M-line where there is only myosin present (no actin overlap)
    - I-band: region of where there is only actin present (no myosin overlap)

### Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)
1. Action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal
2. Voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing for an influx of Calcium ions
3. Calcium ions bind to vesicles, which contain acetylcholine 
4. Vesicles fuse with the membrane, releasing ACh into the synaptic cleft 
5. ACh bind to receptors, allowing an influx of extracellular sodium ions
6. Action potential is generated and spreads to the muscle fiber
7. ACh is removed by enzyme acetylcholinersterase (AChE)


### Skeletal Muscle Activation
*How does the action potentiail get to a core myofibril in muscle fiber cell?*
- The sarcolemma (membrane of the muscle fiber) has holes in it called T-tubules allowing the potential to reach the myofibril. 
- The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a modified endoplasmic reticulum that stores calcium ions.

1. ACh release at NMJ
2. Action potential spreads accross entire sarcolemma and into the holes, T-tubules
3. Ca2+ release by SR into cytoplasm
4. Ca2+ binds to tropomyosin complex, which a fibrous protein that wraps around the actin filament. The calcium ions effectively move the tropomyosin, exposing the active sites on the actin filaments
5. Myosin binds to actin and initiates cross bridging process (muscle contraction)

#### Cross Bridge Cycle ^ 
1. Binding: 
    - ATP hydrolysis to ADP releases energy, energizing the myosin head
    - Myosin attaches to actin forming cross-bridge 
2. Bending:
    - Power stroke 
    - Myosin-actin binding triggers release of stored energy 
    - Myosin pivots (ADP and Pi released) 
    - Pulls actin to center of sarcomere (contraction occurs)
3. Detachement:
    - New ATP binds to myosin head 
    - Decreasing affinity of myosin for actin 
    - Myosin detaches from actin filament 

4. Energized: 
    - Myosin returned to original position 
    - ATP hydrolized to ADP and Pi 
    - Myosin re-energized and prepares for another binding cycle

### Skeletal Muscle Relaxation 
6. ACh is broken down by acetylcholinesterase at the muscle end plate (NMJ where chemical synapse interfaces with muscle fiber)
7. SR uses ATP power pumps to collect Ca2+ ions 
8. Tropomyosin complex covers myosin binding sites on actin filaments
9. Cross cridge binding can no longer occur, compressed titin recoils the sarcomere like a spring 
10. Muscle relaxation occurs




1. **Skeletal System Functions:** Describe the main functions of the skeletal system, including the roles of joints, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.
- Skeleton is meant to provide protection, structure and articulate but does not actuate 
- Joints are regions where bones connect and interface
- Cartilage are shock absorbing tissue that helps reduce friction 
- Ligaments are connections between bones 
- Tendons are connectiosn between bones and muscle

2. **Types of Muscle Contractions:** Define the three types of muscle contractions and provide examples of each.
- Concentric: upper portion of a bicep curl
- Eccenctric: when the bicep curl is descending 
- Isometric: stays the same length

3. **Types of Muscle Tissue:** Compare and contrast skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle in terms of structure, control, and function.
- skeletal: long cylindrical, multinucleated, voluntary control, striated, 
- smooth: glands, involuntary, smooth, non-striated, single nucleated, 
- cardiac muscle: found in the heart, is a mix of striated and non striated, involuntary control 


4. **Skeletal Muscle Structure Layers:** Outline the hierarchical structure of skeletal muscle from the epimysium to the muscle fiber.
- Epimisyium: outer layer surrounding the muscle. fibrous 
- Perimisyium: inner fibrous layer, surrounding a buncle of muscle fascicles
- Fascicle: a grouping of muscle fibers
- Endomysium: wispy connective tissuea round a fascicle
- Muscle fiber: fibers are made of long cylindrical muscle cells -> myofibril -> sarcomere -> myosin and actin

- Z-line: demarks the start and end of the sarcomere
- A-band: region where there is myosin present
- I-band: region where only actin is present
- H-zone: region where only myosin is present 


7. **Neuromuscular Junction Function:** Detail the steps involved in neurotransmitter release and signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction.
- same thing for a chemical synapse, 
- action potential reaches myofibril through t-tubules 
- Ca2+ enter the t-tubules and SR ejects Ca2+ ions 
- Calcium ions bind to the tropomyosin complex exposing the actin, allowing the myosin heads to attach and cross briddge


8. **Skeletal Muscle Activation via the Neuromuscular Junction:** Describe how an action potential travels from the neuromuscular junction to a core myofibril in a muscle fiber cell.
- Cross bridge cycling: 
1. Binding: atp hydrolisis to ADP and Pi on the head of the myosin, energizes and binds to the actin fiber 
2. Bending/power storke: Pulls the actin to the center of the sarcomere, the ATP and PI are released 
3. Detachement: the myosin head binds to a new ATP which decreases its affinity towards the actin filament 
4. Energizing: the ATP undergoes hydrolysis and the myosin head is in its reenergized state ready to undergo another cycle


9. **Calcium's Role in Muscle Contraction:** Explain the process by which calcium ions contribute to muscle contraction within a muscle fiber.

10. **Cross Bridge Cycle in Muscle Contraction:** Describe each step of the cross bridge cycle that leads to muscle contraction.

11. **Muscle Relaxation Process:** Outline the steps involved in muscle relaxation after contraction.
- SR uses atp to recoved the calcium ions 
- Tropomyosin covers the actin s.t. it is no longer exposed to the myosin 
- ACholinesteriase breaks down ACh



## Lecture 16: Skeletal Muscle Function 

### Relationship of an Action Potential to a Muscle Twitch

#### Tension Developed by Each Muscle Fiber
1. Action Potential Frequency: 
- Each action potential causes a muscle twitch 
- For a single action potential, there is a few ms of delay called the latent period, this is the time it takes for the action potential to reach the muscle fiber and for the calcium ions to be released from the SR
    - I.e. the time between stimulation and contraction
- Mumltiple action potentials can cause twitch summations (similar to spatial summation of APs) and the muscle stays contracted instead of twitching (60 Hz)

2. Fiber Length:
- Muscles can be longer or shorter than resting length 
- At resting muslce length, there is optimal overlap between actin and myosin filaments. If the muscle gets longer or shorter the force decreases
    - Contracted muscle 70%, there is more overlap and the force drops sharply
    - Stretched muscle 130%, there is less overlap and the force drops less sharply

3. Fiber Diameter:
- If each myofibril gets **larger**, it can develop more tension (hypertrophy)
- If **more myofibril gets packed into a single muscle fiber**, it can develop more tension (hyperplasia)

4. Fatigue:
- Slow-twitch: endurance, highly resistant to fatigue, aerobic
- Fast-twitch: sprinting, fatigue quickly, aerobic and glycogin 
- Fast-twitch glycolitic: sprinting, anaerobic, fatigue quickly

5. Types of fibers:
- Slow oxidative: 


#### Tension Developed by Several Fibers
1. Number of fibers per motor unit: 
- More recruitment of motor units = more force


2. Number of active motor units



## Lecture 17: Cardiac Muscle and ECG

### Structure of the heart
- Two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers)
- Each ventricle has an AV valve and a semilunar
    - AV valve prevents backflow of blood into the atria 
    - Semilunar valve prevents backflow of blood into the ventricles 
        - Connects to arteries
- Right side received deoxygenated blood from the body and sends it to the lungs
- Left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and sends it to the body


### ECG (Electrocardiogram)
- We use the two cell model of the ECG to understand the electrical activity of the heart 
    - Cell A: left and right atrium, upper two chambers of the heart
    - Cell B: left and right ventricle lower caudal chambers of the heart
- Each cell has a voltage. By measuring the intracellular voltage of the cells, and subtracting the two, we are shown the equivalent features of the ECG. 
- The delay in voltage comes from the gap junction between neurons at electrical synapses. 
- There are three possible states for cell A and B: 
1. Polarized (resting)
2. Depolarized (active and contraction)
3. Repolarizing (returning to resting state) 

$$ I_{AB} = \frac{V_A - V_B}{R_{AB}}$$


### Cardiac APs differ from neurons and skeletal muscle 
- Specialized ion channels and currents in cardiac cells 
- Rapid depolarization not followed by quick repolarization
- AP plateaus near 0 mV due to balance between Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux
- Extended dureation of signal prevents premature re-excitation (heart can refill with blood)

### APs across Cardiac Cells in the Conduction Network 
1. SA node: pacemaker 
2. Atrial muscle
3. Atrioventricular node 
4. Purkinje fibres 
5. Ventricular muscle


### Sequence of Depolarization
Depolarize Atria
1. SA fires, atrial depolarization across both right and left cells 
2. Atrial muscle cells depolarize and contract 
3. Atrioventricular node: delay and slows the conduction, allowing atria to fully empty into the ventricles

Depolarize septum from left to right
4. Bundle of his into Purkinje Fibers triggers ventricular depolarization


Depolarize anterospetal region of myocardium towards apex 
5. Ventricular muscle contraction
6. Ventricular muscle relaxation (repolarization)

### Explanation of the PQRST wave: 
1. P-wave: SA node fires and leads to atrial depolarization (atrial ejection) 
2. PR segment: delay at the AV node impulse is travelling through gap junction resistances going to the bundle of His. The delay allows all the blood to be pumped into the ventricles 
3. QRS complex: ventricular depolarization (ventricular ejection) 
4. ST segment: represents the delay between ventricular depolarization and repolarization
5. T-wave: ventricular repolarization (ventricular relaxation)



### Major Events of Left ventricular Cardiac Cycle
1. Passive filling: 
    - AV valves open as ventricular pressure decreases 
    - Both chambers open to passive filling 
2. Atrial ejection:
    - Atrial contraction forces a small amount of blood into ventricles 

3. Isovolumic ventricular contraction: 
    - First phase of ventricular contraction 
    - Pushes AV valves closed 
    - Semilunar valves are still closed 

4. Ventricular ejection: 
    - Pressure in ventricles exceeds pressure in arteries 
    - Semilunar valves open
    - Blood is ejected into arteries

5. Isovolumic ventricular relaxation: 
    - Ventricles relaxes
    - Pressure in ventricles drops 
    - Semilunar valves close
    - AV valves are still closed

### Stroke Volume (SV)
- Note there will always be some blood left in the ventricles after ejection, this is called the end-systolic volume (ESV)
- The volume at the beginning is called the end-diastolic volume (EDV)
$$SV = EDV - ESV$$

## Lecture 18: Cardiac Regulation

### Major Events of Left Ventricular Cardiac Cycle
- Ventricular Systole "lub" sound: AV valves closing during the first phase of isovolumic ventricular contraction 
- Ventricular Dyastole "dub" sound: semi lunar valves closing during isovolumic ventricular relaxation


### Pressure Changes in Atria 
-


### Cardiac Output 
- Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute
$$CO = HR \times SV$$

1. Rate of depolarization:
- Slower rate of depolarization takes more time to reach threshold, and the heart rate is slower
2. Shift in minimum potential:
- If we start from a lower $V_m$, (a larger negative), then it takes more time to reach threshold
3. Shift in threshold potential:
- If we increase the threshold potential, it takes more time to reach threshold


### Extrinsic Control of Heart Rate 
Autonomic effects on the heart rate

#### Parasympathetic (Vagal) Stimulation
- The vagus nerve releases ACh 
- SA nodal cells have M2 (muscarinic) receptors that respond to ACh
- We know that M2 receptors lead to inhibition of target cells by enhancing the permeability of K+
- This leads to a hyperpolarization of the cell, which shifts the minimum potenital down, decreasing the heart rate 
- This makes sense since the parasympathetic system is responsible for rest and digest, so the heart rate should be lower

#### Sympathetic Stimulation
- Sympathetic nerve releaseses NE and cardiomyocyte has B1 adrenergic receptors, leading to excitation of target cells 
- Thus, sympathetic stimulation leads to an increase in permeability of Ca2+ ions (recall that there is more calcium in the extracellular fluid than the intracellular fluid)
- Thus, the threshold potential is shifted downwards, thus, decreaseing the time it takes to reach AP 

#### Autonomic Tone
There is always the influence of the parasympathetic and symapathetic systems. That is to say, there is no "on/off" state bur rather "more/less" influence.
- Vagal and Sympathetic Tone: 
    - Intrinsic HR: HR under complete pharmacological blockade


### Extrinsic Control of Heart Rate 
- Sympathetic stimulation (Norepinephereine) enhances Ca2+ currens , which increases the force developed by ventricular myocytes 
- So the end-systolic volume might be somewhere around 35 mL


### Frank-Starling Law of the Heart
- Inotropic effect: when nervous system or medication changes the contractility of the heart 


To summarize, parasympathetic activity decreases the heart rate through hyperpolarization, since potassium permeability is increased through ACh and the M2 muscarinic receptor, so HR is decreased.
Sympathetic activity increases the heart rate through depolarization, since calcium permeability is increased through NE and the B1 adrenergic receptor, so HR is increased.
The sympathetic system also increases the force of contraction, which is called the inotropic effect, increasing the stroke volume. 

So both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems change HR, but only sympathetic can change the stroke volume through force of contraction


## Lecture 19: Blood Vessels and Blood Pressure
### Smooth Muscle: ST(H)OVE 
- Skin: arrector pili of skin
- Tract: GI, respitory, reproductive, uterus 
- Hollow: walls of stomach, intestines, uterus, bladder 
- Vessel: aorta, arteries, arterioles, veins, lymphatic vessels
- Eye: ciliary muscle and iris


### Smooth vs Skeletal muscle 
Skeletal: 
- Long and cylindrical
- Striated
- Multinucleated
- Enables voluntary movement
- Attached to bones 
- Quick powerful contraction 
- Respond to nervous system

Smooth:
- Short, spindle shaped
- Non-striated (smooth)
- Single nucleus 
- Facilitates involuntary processes 
- In walls of internal organs 
- Slow sustained contractions 
- Cell junctions connect and support function 
- Respond to hormones and nervous system 

### Calcium Ion Permeability
- Autonomic stimulation (i.e. neurotransmitters) change the availability of Ca2+ in the sytosol of smooth muscle cells 
- Smooth muscle cells have a sufficient level of calcium ions to maintain a low level of tensions and are sensitive to varying degrees of autonomic neurotransmitters depending on the distribution of cholingergic and adrenergic receptrs. 


### Innervation of Smooth Muscle 
- Skeletal Muscle has nerve connections through the neuromuscular junction 
- Smooth muscle has nerve connections through varicosity 

### Varicosity 
- Swelling at end of nerves 
- Releasing neurotrasmitter into wide synaptic cleft (diffuse junction)
- Neurotramsitter diffuse across cleft and affeccting smooth muscle cells 
- Allows 1 nerve ending to impact many SMCs at once 


### Vasciular System Structure and Function 
- Arteries: carry blood away from the heart 
    - Pulmanory artery carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs and is connected to the right ventricle
    - The aorta carries oxygenated blood to the entire body and is connected to the left ventricle
- Veins: carry blood to the heart: 
    - Pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood to the heart from the lungs and is connected to the left atrium
    - Vena cava carries deoxygenated blood to the heart from the body and is connected to the right atrium


#### Structure of Blood Vessels
- Tunic Externa: 
    - Sturctural support 
    - Collagen and loose elastic fibers

- Tunica Media: 
    - Support change in vessel diameter and regulate blood flow 
    - SMC, collagen and elastic tissue 

- Tunica Intima: 
    - Single layer of endothelial cells
    - Release chemicals and support gas exchange 

Note that there are differening amounts of these layers (endothelium, elastic fibers, smooth muscle and collagen) in different types of vessels.

### Factors Affecting Diameter of Systemic Arterioles 

#### Extrinsic
- Vasodilation:
    - A decrease in sympathetic stimulation 

- Vasoconstriction: 
    - An increase in sympathetic stimulation


#### Intrinsic
- Vasodilation:
    - Decrease in myogenic activity 
    - Decrease in oxygen 
    - Increase in CO2
    - NO increase 

- Vasoconstriction:
    - Increase in myogenic activity
    - Increase in oxygen
    - Decrease in CO2
    - Endothelin increase



#### Environmental
- Vasodilation: 
    - Hot 
- Vasoconstriction: 
    - Cold



### Pressure And Flow Relationships in Circular Vessels 
- P = Pressure 
- Q = flow = cardiac output 
- r = Radius 
- L = Length
#### Pouiseuille's Law
- We can calculate the mean arterial pressure difference 

$$ \Delta P = Q \frac{8 \eta L}{\pi r^4}$$
Where we define the total peripheral resistance as: 
$$ TPR = \frac{8 \eta L}{\pi r^4}$$

Thus, 
$$ \Delta P = CO \times TPR$$


### Facotrs that Alter Resistance 
- Blood viscosity: 
    - number of RBCs 

- Arterial radius: 
    - Vasoconstriction and vasodilation 
        - Influences through intrinsic, extrinsic and environmental factors
