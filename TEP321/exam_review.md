# History of Science Communication


## Structuring an argument
- Evidence, claim and warrant
- Cite passages from the text and identify what you think they mean, then explain how the passage can be interpreted in that way
- {These} authorial choics had {this} impact on the ... which hae this impact on the science itself. 

## Three main steps in SC and popular science development: 
1. Industrial and scientific revolution results in a flurry of scientific activity with social impacts 
2. Institutionalization of science as a distinct activity with its own rules and practices 
3. Different media for dissemination of scientific theories

### In the late 19th century, popularization is seen as the job of the scientist:
- Like Darwin's OotS
- Scientific discourse was very personal, "what I think" 
- Lack of a clear distinction between science and popular science due to no institutions and widely agreed upon methods 


### Early 20th
- Increasing specialization and professionalization 
- Rise of the technical scientific paper and peer review 
- Little time for popularization and was frowned upon
    - e.g. Sagan seen as a popularizer, not a scientist by his peers 

### Late 20th
- Scientists take up the role of popularizers again 
- Rise of science journalism 
    - Popularity was key to securing funding and remaining relevant
- Rise of new media and new pathways to communicate science 
    - e.g. TV, internet, social media

## Science's Path to the Public
- Scientists have control over how their work is received by the public by preparing journalists to select, understand and frame stories
    - Importance of the media kit:  
        - Press releases and backgrounders simplify and guide journalists
        - Approced quotations for use 
        - Important figures and visuals 

### Journalistics vs Scientific Values 
- The final product of journalism is determined by journalistic values and processes rather than scientific ones
1. Topics are chosen to reflect core news values, processes and audience 
- Math is boring and can't be "used" by the general public, whereas medicine, nutrition and health is much more common 
2. Content of articles driven by journalistic values 
- Focus on results and implications, not the scientific method
- Published around "pegs" (PINTS)
3. Journalistic balance over scientific validity 
- Any uncertainty in science involves qualifying and balance reporting
- Exploration of both sides of the argument 
- e.g. climate science, evolution, vaccines 
4. Question of journalistic vs scientific accuracy
- Errors of comission (including incorrect information) vs omission (leaving out findings)
- Conditional claims (only considering one perspective) vs reproducibility (peer review)

### The Deficit Model 
**Professionals:** create the science
- Inaccesssible to outsiders 
- Only engaged in professional communication 

**Journalist:** fill the knowledge gap between the public and the professionals
- Translator and mediator of knowledge
- Motivated by other processes and values

**Public:** consumers of information
- Incapable of grasping technical details
- Interested only in the practical applications 
- Litte patience for the rigorous scientific method

#### Issues with the Deficit Model
- Sceince is too complicated 
- Mediation between the public and the professionals is necessary
- "Translation" is needed, although "lossy"
1. The public does not have the same level of scientific understanding 
2. Engagement by scientists is important
3. Is it possible to translate
4. "Lossy" model
5. Improper presentation of scientific uncertainty and disagreements within the field 

## Tools for Science Communication
### PINTS
- Peg: why is this story being told now? Why do I want to know about that at that point?
- Interesting: Why would a reader read this? 
- Novel: How is this new? What advance does it represent over new things?
- Tension: What confloct arises from the work? 
- Significance" Why should I care about this work? How will it change my life or others? 

### Narrative
- Fabula (story): the objective sequence of events and actions
- Szujet (discourse): how the story is told, the narrative structure, which leads to specific choices in: 
    - Selection
    - Representation
    - Arrangement
- e.g. the scientist as a hero, hypotheses as a form of narrative, scientist tropes
- Narrative emphasizes the eccentricity of the scientist, making them seem like characters in a story 
- Emotional investment through these characters
- Tropes are often included

### Metaphor
- From the greek work meaning it "transfer", comparing seemingly unrelated subjects to better understand the target subject
- Original understanding was dangerous, distancing us from the objective truth
- The deficit model employs metaphor, but it can lead to inferior translation 
- Metahpors are limited in scope and can't always satisfy:
    - e.g. the crown of the corona virus isn't actually a crown, but more of a spike and resembles a morning star rather than a crown. 


### Framing
- Two opposing opinions in framing
1. Matthew Nisbet and Chris Mooney:
    - "Without misrepreseenting scientific information, scientists must learn to actively frame information to make it relevant to different audiences"
    - "Frames organize central ideas, They pare down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. They allow citizens to rapidly identify why an issue matters, who might be responseilbe and what should be done" 

2. PZ Myers

## Academic Publishing Today 
- Prior to open access journals the process was: 
    - submission, editorial review, sent to reviewers, reports to editors, revision and then publishing, with an emphasis on review and revision
- With open access, the process is a lot more linear, 
- While the public has access to the research, the process is less rigorous
- Shift towards publishing as much as possible

## Risk Communication
1. Responsible communicate degree of threat/risk given what is known 
2. Create trust bewteen the public and key authorities (scientists, politicians, doctors)
3. Motivate appropriate risk mitigation 


## 1. Case Study: L’aquila Earthquake materials
Summary: Meeting took place in March 2009, following a series of treemors. After the meeting, government officials reassured the public that there was no risk. Outrage against the scientists and officials after the earthquake. 6 scientists and 1 gov't official were charged with manslaughter, as they provided "inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory information". Trial was met with criticism from the international scientific community, earthquake prediction is not reliable enough.
Implications: scientists might be more hesitant to provide information relating to risk communication. Less likely to publicly share results of resesarch and less willing to engage with the public. Scientists lack of engagement and dialogue with the public is a problem; a deeper understanding of risk communication is needed.


Development: 
1. Open access journals, open data 
2. Public respositories
3. Visualization tools 
4. Technologies that enable the creation of high speed communication of data 
5. In the hands of the public or media "Information wants to be free"
6. Greater scrutiny of communication processes

Impact-Evolved Participatory Model
Consider Hurricane Sandy, platforms, hastags, videos, numbers allowed users to have a better understanding of the storm and the were able to make decisions based on the information provided. 

## 2. Introduction to Science Journalism (4 articles)
- Why does a story get published? 
- How does it show the science? What does it focus on?
- What strategies/tools are used to appeal to the audience?
- What do these reads say about science journalism?
**Key Takeaways**:
- Use of "click bait" headlines and ledes 
- Focus on results, but few details on methods 
- "Human interest"
- Authority of the scientist
- Appeal to controvery and novelty 
- Use of figurative language and metaphor
1. How the brain responds to beauty
    Click bait title, reader goes into the article thinking its about human beauty, but it's more about architecture 

2. 20 seconds of dread (curiosity rover)
    Focus on the human element of the engineers and their creativity and dedication
    Sparks inspiration and human wonder for the reader
    Metaphors: the room "just explodes"
    Misconception of "nerdy" scientists

3.  Questions Advantages of Organic Meat and Produce
    Science you can use, practical applications (grocery shopping)
    Stanford researchers wish to provide an objective review to allow people to make "informed choices"
    "Does an organic strawberry contain more vitamin C than a conventional one?"
    Journalistic balance: 
    - 237 different studies, "size of difference varied widely from study to study" 
    - Conflicting studies 
    - Consideration of other variables: ripeness, location, weather, taste not taken into account
    Embedded in the text, there are blurbs about "facts behind 5 supplements" 

4. How men reacted Titanic and Lusitania
- Human interest, emotional appeal, sex
- "When you have to react very fast, human instincts are much faster than internalized social norms" 
- Numbers are provided

5. Battle for Survival may yield the rain forest's diversity
- facts on biodiversity and the rainforest
- Battle between insects and plants, for sunlight and water


## 3. Materials from Case Study: Higgs’s Boson & Large Hadron Collider:

### 1. Newspaper: after particle search, some wallets may lose mass
- Focusing on the fact that this is a gamble 
- 
### 2. Quirks and Quarks
- Dr Richard Toisher, Trador brought in a guests. "What are the forces of the universe". Discovery of new physics, gamble of the LHC. Focus just on the Higgs Boson and its scale. 27 km in circumference, 100m underground, 7000 tons of steel. Atlas is a detector "cathedral size detector", "comically large" 
- Simple analogies of nuclear warheads. Creating the early conditions of the universe (high energy)
- Standard model, found everything except the Higgs Boson.
- "this is the part where non physicists just nod and smile", interaction with "virtual higgs"
- "very much like an undiscovered country" 
- "Impliciations aren't just for physisct geeks": pandering to the public 100 years ago, electron was discovered, no one knew what it was for. 
- "Eureka"
### 3. LHC Rap
- Graphics are used to demonstrate the scale of the LHC and the sorts of experiments that will take place
- Pandering to a younger audience: metaphor with anti matter and matter like spiderman and venom 
- Still lots of accurate information, but presented in a more engaging way
### 4. PhD Comics
- Day in the life: audio recording is taken at the CERN over lunch 
- Targets students who are interested in physics 
- Discovery and the higgs boson
- Each drawing contains the narrator and the viewer, the viewer is learning from the narrator both in the drawings and through the audio.
- Qeustions: "what are the forces", "are there other particles" 
- Metaphor: with the tophat: being at a restaurant and you have some energy, how mych can you order? 

## 4. Charles Darwin’s Origin of the Species
- Darwin is the first scientific celebrity 
- Scientific method was not yet properly established, modes of argument are anecdotal, different from today's scene
- Written with lots of qualifiers and a narrative frame due to the novelty of the field of evolutionary biology
- "This abstract which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect, I cannot here give references and authorities" 
- Connections: paving the way for the scientific paper, specialization, professionalization

## 5. Case Study: Ted Sargent paper, Press release/backgrounder, & Star article
- Paper: Focusing on optoelectronic materials and their ability to absorb broad spectrum light. State of the art, new research on the topic 
- Backgrounder: opinions from multiple experts not involved in the study, MIT, Standford, Lux Capital etc. Sargent says that the tech is able to harness IR light from the sun, which was not previously possible. Sargent gives estimate of "3-5 years" for implementation. 
- U of T news: focus on the scientific method and less so on sci-fi potential applications. Emphasizes the contributions of U of T. 
- Toronto Star: "Film sprayed on shirts could recharge iPods." "Star Trek dream", portraying the research as sci-fi technology that was "invented" rather than discovered or researched. Framed as a narrative, brilliant ted sargent. Emphasis on investments into the technology: "literally materially changes the way that energy is absorbed" 
Connections: lossy model of translation, assmuption that readers are not interested in the scientific method, focus on the practical, sci-fi applications even though they may take a while 


## 6. Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, Lecture
Modes of discourse Szujet:
1. Narratival: 
    - Structure is dominated by a arrative, author accepts the role of a storyteller, communicating directly to the reader. Structured into one episode of history or one biography of a famous scientist 
2. Expository:
    - Exposision purpose is to explain, inform and define, very much pedagogical.
3. Investigative:
    - Journalistic in style, taking up controversial subjects with balanced coverage, often with a focus on the human element
4. Scientist tropes and characters:
    - Mad scientist, american, eccentric, genius, hero, villain, etc.
    - Scietists are shown through their actions, thoughts and through Bryson's tone 


## 7. "Pandora bacteria" research article, New Scientist article, Class Articles
- Pandora bacteria article uses PINTS: peg, interest, novelty, tension, significance
- Peg: avatar had recently come out. Framing the discovery as similar to the network of life found in the movie. 
- Interest: new bacteria found in the deep sea, symbiosis is similar to Pandora's 
- Novelty: "bacteria can live in electric symbiosis over great distances"
- Tension: between those that wish to harness the bacteria for energy purposes and those that wish to figure out "what's going on in nature". Journalist frame ie it as "some resesarchers believe that bacteria", instead of a definitive statement. 
- Significance: could be used to build "microbial fuel cells", could be used in future applications


## 8. Materials on Academic Publishing:
- Scientists public academic papers to share their findings with the scientific community and legitimize their position at their university.
Articles: 
1. Fake scientific papers 
2. More than 10,000 papers were retracted
3. "Too greedy" Elsevier 
4. Science journals that will publish anything
- In sum open access has lead to a decrease in the quality of academic publishing, as the process is less rigorous. We refer to predatory journals as those that desire to get you to publish with them. Often times, the peer review process is flawed or lacking, leading to shorter turnover times. For journals to remain open access however, the scientists must pay a fee to have their papers published in these oligopolistic journals. Some scientists have resoted to peer review rings, where they review each other's papers to ensure that they are published.

Important factors when publishing:
1. Time: the publishing process is lengthy requires constant feedback and revision between blind peer reviewers and the authors.
2. Quality of review: peer review is not meant to detect fraud, we assume that the work and data is real 
3. Accessibility: without membrrship, the public cannot access most scientific research. As such there has been a movement toward free and open access journals. (PLos, Google scholar, Pubmed). However, who is paying for OA? While open access is great, as it becomes larger and larger, opportunities for fraud and predatory journals increase.
## 9. Case Study: NASA’s Arsenic Based Bacteria
- Science through press conference can be understood through performance studies consider: appearance, setting, content and manner
- Note on embargoes: a request by a source that news not be publisehd prior to specified time. Allows journalists time to readh, research and write more accurate articles 
- Tensions between Felisa Wolfe Simon and Steven Benner. Simon takes on the frame similar to Bryson, that is in awe of science, stating that "she is interested in exceptions"
- Use of makeup and very open setting, odd layout as table was low and they weren't really speaking to each other but rather just to the camera. Allows for the audience to feel like they are part of the conversation, we have the speaker's demeanor, hand gestures, facial expressions, tone, cadence, etc. 
- Screen and animation helps to visualize the subtitution of phosphorus with arsenic.
- Tension with Benner states that he is the "wet blanket", "exceptional claim" "scratching his head sarcastically" "clashing between believers and disbelievers in the goal to come up with the truth"
- Consider also the roles that we have here, the male supervisor with a strong reputation vs this new female scientist that is new to the field.
- Rosie Redfield's blog post: "This paper should not have been published", and is unable to replicate the results.

## 10. Case Study: Sarah Palin’s Fruit Fly-gate
- Science and public policy are intertwined, as science is used to inform policy decisions.
- In 2008, there was a lot of controversy surrounding public funding for scientific research, particularly in the field of genetics. Sarah Palin states that "fruit fly research in Paris, France" is a waste of taxpayer money.
- However, fruit fly research is seminal in the field of genetics, as they are a model organism that is easy to manipulate and study. In fact it is the best model organism for autism research, same with alzheimer's and parkinson's.
- PZ myers jumps on her mistake.




## 11. Nisbet and Mooney’s Editorial and Responses
- Nisbet and Mooney (accomodationist): discusses tthe challenges and strategies in communicating science to public particularly in politically charged topics like climate change, evolutions and embryonic stem cells. Presentation of facts (Fabula) is not enough due to different people having different values and preconceptions. Instead the authors say that all information should be framed. While some scientists may believe that this is manipulative, Nisbet and Mooney argue that the facts are not enough in some cases.
- "Frames organize central ideas" 
- "Messages on evolution" must be positive and respect diversity 
All news media and scientists assume: 
1. All scientific communication involves framing 


- (Militant Athiest) Response: "Dishonest", "framing adds ideaology" "Slippery slope" "sacrifices credibility"
- "frames are much more than simply leaving out details" 
- N and M perpetuate two myths:
1. Complexity cannot be communicated 
2. Blames the public and alienates science from society


## 12. Before the Flood
- Takes on the lens of DiCaprio, who is a UN ambassador for climate change.
- Frame of the film is that of a journey, DiCaprio is learning about climate change as he goes along, humble and curious.
- One might question DiCaprio's role and the use of celebrities to promote social change.
- Focus on what the public can do to help, but these actions are not enough (reduce carbon footprint, shift dietary choices, reduce waste etc). The documentary does not mention that the majority of emissions come from larger coporations that are greater than the individual.

Climate change how to communicate risk and move those that are doutbful and dismissies to become more concerned. How can we use psychologica lessons to create policies that are more effective.
1. The human brain privleges experience over analysis. Highlight relevant personal experiences through recall, metaphors. 
2. People are social beings who respon to group norms. Activate and leverage relevant social group norms for group actions.
3. Out of sight out of mind. Emphasize the present.
4. Nobody likes losing but everyone likes gaining. Frame policy solutions in terms of what can be gained.
5. Tapping the potential of human motivation. Motivation


## 13. The Star’s Gardasil Story + Vaccine Hesitancy
- Gardasil Story: too anecdotal, very much focused on the human element, and not so much on the numbers. Unproven claims relying on bad data. The Star cherry picked damning cases about the vaccine. 
- Young girls dying or getting sick is bad, but to attribute the harms to the vaccine is not corrrect, and does not constitute as proof
- Looking at the numbers out of 800 k who took the vaccine, there have only been 60 cases of adverse effects, which represent 0.0075% of the population.
- This story supports the anti-vax cause, and is a dangerous example. 
- Vaccine hesitancy continue to remain a major issue in health communication: measles cases in europe quadrupled for example in 2017
- Reasons:
    - Misinformation through media outlets, celebrities 
    - Natural health (essential oils, etc)
    - Relative availability for less developed regions
    - Polarized politicial climate and personal freedom in favour of public health
    - Lack of trust in the government and large pharma
    
## 14. Anti-Vaccination Origins and Modern Incarnations (MMR)
- Andrew Wakefield's study in 1998, published in the Lancet, was the first to suggest a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The study was later retracted, and Wakefield was stripped of his medical license.
- Study sample was only 12 children that were recruited by a lawyer that was preppin a suit against MMR companies. Results were anectodotal and children were monitored by their parents. 



## 15. Pseudoscience Websites: Goop , TB12, Dr. Oz
- Pseudoscience relies on scientific characteristics and activities for its credibility and authority 
- Science is not conducted within the scientific method and does not meet standards of rigor
- Often reliant on credientials alone for authority and promotion (ethos)
- Goop: Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand, promotes "wellness" and "clean" living. Often promotes products that are not scientifically proven to be effective and are often harmful. Aims to promote a feminist response to the medical establishmane that has not taken women' issues seriously enough
- TB12: Tom Brady's lifestyle brand, promotes a "clean" diet and lifestyle, but at a huge cost. Consumers are paying for the brandname. In their TOS, they state that "We are not responsible if information made available via the Service is not accurate, complete or current." and "Please be advised, however, that neither TB12 Inc nor its authors are engaged in rendering medical, health, nutritional, or similar healthcare services via the Service". Aims to promote a healthy lifestyle.
- Dr. Oz: Promotes "green coffee bean extract" as a weight loss supplement, but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Aims to fill gap created by the American Healthcare system.




## Questions: 
___
1. **Analyze the Role of Social Media in Science Communication: How does the use of social media platforms challenge or reinforce the deficit model of science communication? Discuss with examples where social media has successfully bridged the gap between scientists and the public, and where it has failed.**
- One of the steps required for science communication is the development of new media forms for the dessemination of scientific theories. 
- Social media has been key to acceessible science information.
- Pro: consider how risk was communicated during Hurricane Sandy, platforms, hastags and videos enabled the general public to make their own decisions based on the information provided. This is an example where information lies in the hands of the public or media, and is a form of "information wants to be free".
- Cons: consider TikTok and the rise of sephora kids. Kids will spread misinformation about products that all tweens will need, when, in reality, these products are damaging for their well being and skin barrier. In this case, instead of listening to doctors, younger children listen to their favourite influencers and celebrities.

2. **Impact of Celebrity Endorsements on Public Understanding of Science: Evaluate the effect of celebrity endorsements in science communication. Provide examples where such endorsements have either helped or hindered public understanding of scientific issues.**
- Example of Gweneeth Paltrow and Goop, toxic shock, products that are said to be scientifically, sound when they aren't. 


3. **Discuss the Implications of Oversimplified Science Messages: How can oversimplifying complex scientific data in media communications mislead the public? Use a specific case study from recent media to illustrate your points.**
- Giving the wrong idea about new technologies: consider the Sargent lab or the Pandora bacteria. The Star overhyped the technology and overestimated its potentials and applications. Also consider Theranos where Elizabeth Holmes was able to convince investors that her idea and tech was revolutionary—using the idea of a "black box" to oversimplify the technology. We really care about what investors think, so if the business side of things is sound, why shouldn't the science? 
4. **Comparison of Expert and Public Perceptions of Scientific Controversies: Choose a current scientific controversy and compare how it is perceived by scientific experts versus the general public. Discuss how the deficit model and lossy translation influence these perceptions.**
- Vaccinations and gardasil. 
- Consider journalistic balance over scientific validity. Tensions are great as they are enticing and they make for a good, trending story. 
- Star chose the most damning cases of Gardasil and presented them as empirical proof that the vaccine was harmful.
- Received a lot of backlash. Vaccines hesitancy should not be an issue, and is a charged subject in which tensions should be more carefully considered. These fuels are just more evidence for those that are already against vaccines.

___


1. **How could participatory models have impacted the outcome of the L'Aquila earthquake communication compared to the traditional deficit model?**
- Participatory models allow for more engagement and discussion with the public. We must also consider that media in 2009 was not as advanced as it is today; however, if scientists had communicate their risks as such, and let the people decide for themselves, rather than the government stating that everything is okay, then things would have been different. The traditional deficit model assumes that science needs to be communicated by some mediator, in this case the government, and that the public is not capable of understanding the ideas of risk.
2. **What are the legal and ethical responsibilities of scientists in communicating risk, especially in cases like the L'Aquila earthquake where predictions carry significant uncertainties?**
- Are they in the wrong, yes, but they should not have been pursued in this manner. While scientists should report to government officials, in matters like this, it is also important for the scientist to speak out directly to the public, if they find that the gov't is not doing a sound enough job.
- Science is not always certain, and rarely can we predict certain events; however, it is important to properly communicate the risk associated with certain events. 
- Scientists should not be afraid to speak out, and should not be afraid to communicate the uncertainties associated with their work.

___

1. **How do clickbait titles like "How the brain responds to beauty" affect reader expectations and engagement with scientific content?**
- PINTS is used as a framework, titles and ledes fall within the "peg" and "interest" categories. 
- To get readership and interaction, journalists use clickbait titles and ledes to draw in readers. 
- We can also consider the "novelty" aspect, wherein some articles will focus on the latest events like sports, politics, etc. to peg the reader's attention, and then talk about an unrelated topic.

2. **What role does human interest play in enhancing the appeal of science stories, as seen in the article about the Curiosity rover's '20 seconds of dread'?**
- The reader is placed in the shoes of an engineer in the project. They aren't geeky, they're craetive human beings. 
- The article leverages the human and motivational element of the reader. 
- There is an element of suspense and tension where the margins for failure are very slim.

3. **How does journalistic balance in reporting on studies, such as in the "Advantages of Organic Meat and Produce?" article, impact public understanding of scientific uncertainty?**
- Use of tensions, for example, other studies have found conflicting results and data 
- Use of significance, why should I care about this work? Food and produce shopping is highly relevant to the general public.
- Less of a focus on the scientific method, but more on the implications, and results of the study.
- Use of anecdotes that have likely been thought of by the reader at some point





___

1. **Discuss the role of metaphor in science communication**: How did the use of metaphors like "nuclear warheads" and "undiscovered country" in the Quirks and Quarks podcast about the LHC influence public understanding and perception of the research?
- Bringing in scientists that work on the public that have a better understanding of the public's knowledge 
- Metaphors simplify things, we compare nuclear warheads to the energy that is being used in the LHC to create mass instead of destroy it 
- Scientists also wish for the reader to understand the scale of the LHC 
- Lots of metaphors like all of DT can fit within the ring 
- Clear assumption of roles, "non physicts" 


2. **Analyze the impact of the "lossy model" in science journalism**: Considering the example of Ted Sargent's research coverage, how does the "lossy model" of translation affect the public's understanding of scientific breakthroughs and their implications?
- Lossy model is created through the gradual translation from the paper, to the pr kit, to the news outlet 
- Not so much of a focus on the scientific method, but on the applications, specifically through the embelishment of the applications. Relating this to the publish or perish frame of mind, one could argue that this sort of embelishment is needed for a researcher and their lab to maintain funding and relevance within the public sphere.


3. **Evaluate the effectiveness of different communication strategies in the LHC case study**: How did the varied approaches—from the PhD Comics' audio recordings to the LHC Rap video—affect different audience segments' engagement with and understanding of the science behind the Large Hadron Collider?
- Depends on the audience, PhD comics is more for students who are interested in modern physics, whereas teh LHC rap video would be for a younger audience. 
- Both do a good job of communicating the science, by using metaphors 

4. **Examine the ethical dimensions of risk communication**: Reflect on the L'Aquila earthquake case. What are the ethical responsibilities of scientists in communicating risks to the public, especially when predictions involve significant uncertainties?
-

5. **Assess the implications of celebrity involvement in science communication**: Using Leonardo DiCaprio's role in "Before the Flood" as a case study, discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of celebrities promoting scientific causes and information.
- Celebrities are a great way to get people exicted. Leo is very popular, and many of his fans were itnroduced to these notions because of his appearance. Moreover, also consider how he interviewed lots of other public figures of great importance. If for example, they just used some other host, there may not have been as many people to speak on this issue and give their opinion
- However, we must consider his restrictions in terms of what he can say, for example, the documentary tells the viewer that they personally can help fight against climate change, even though in reality, their actions will not make a difference. 
- Moreover, there is the potential for backlash from the public if the find that Dicaprio or other figures mentioned don't follow the lifestyle that they so advocate for. 
- A large potion of emissions come from large corporations 
- This is an example of using a narrative and celebrity frame as "interesting" in the PINTS model 


6. Explore the Consequences of Sensationalism in Science Journalism: Reflect on the coverage of NASA’s arsenic-based bacteria research. How does sensationalism affect public trust and understanding of science? What are the potential long-term effects on scientific literacy?
- Felisa Wolfe Simons is known for her intrigue fascination with life. Through the press conference, the audience can better understand the magnitude and importance of this subject by hearing her cadence, her positive and optimistic tone, her engaged demeanor. 
- However, in her case, these elements brought positive attention to her flawed study. 
- Overhyping ones' own science is detrimental to scientific literacy, and overall puts less trust in our public instutitions from the public's perspective. 
- As Benner says, it is important to have that "wet blanket" attitude towards things, and consider these exceptional results, otherwise, other members of the scientific community will pounce on your mistakes.

7. Analyze the Influence of Open Access on Academic Publishing: Discuss the implications of open access publishing on the quality and integrity of scientific research, referencing the concerns over predatory journals and the shift towards publishing quantity over quality.
- Before open acess, the publishing process was arguably more rigorous in a non linear sense (list the processes), with an emphasis on the revision steps 
- Now, some scientists abide more by the publish or perish mindset, wherein they must publish as many articles as they can to remain relevant in terms of funding and tenure. 
- There has been an overall decrease int he quality of publishing. Predatory journals partake in academic misconduct including hiring peer reviewers who are not experts in the subject, and publishing articles in seemingly irrelevant journals. 

8. Investigate the Framing of Science Communication in Media: Using the example of Nisbet and Mooney’s editorial on framing science communication, discuss how different framing strategies can alter public reception and understanding of scientific issues like climate change or evolution.
- Frames: economic consequences frame 
- Public accountability frame 
- Impact on framing: influence on policy and public opinion, different 

9. Critique the Use of Anecdotal Evidence in Vaccine Communication: Examine the journalistic approach in The Star’s Gardasil story. How does reliance on anecdotal evidence impact public perception of vaccine safety and efficacy?
- balance -> choosing damning cases, the worst of the worse 
- use of images of the girls, as with the mother (after the girl had passed)
- anecdotes blind us of the truth at times
- medicine is a difficult topic as we are so vulnerable to the irrationalities of story and narrative 
- in all, this is is an example of journalistic values of balance and tension and almost clickbait are immoral and incorrect. implications:
