# Hypothesis Testing for Two Means

## Known $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$
**Hypothesis**: 
- Nyll hypotehsis: $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_s = d_0$
- Alternative hypothesis (two-sided) $H_1: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq d_0$
- Alternative hypothesis (left-tailed) $H_1: \mu_1 - \mu_2 < d_0$
- Alternative hypothesis (right-tailed) $H_1: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > d_0$

**Test Statistic**:
$$ Z = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - d_0}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim N(0, 1)$$
- where $\bar{X}_1$ and $\bar{X}_2$ are the sample means, $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ are the population variances, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes.


## Unknown but Equal Variances 
**Hypothesis**:
same as above 

**Test Statistic**:
$$ t = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - d_0}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}} \sim t_{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$$

- We take degrees of freedom to be $v = n_1 + n_2 - 2$. Where we make use of the pooled variance : 
$$ s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$$

## Unknown and Unequal Variances 
- We know that $\sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$
**Hypothesis**:
same as above

**Test Statistic**:
$$ T' = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - d_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim t_{\nu}$$
- Where the degrees of freedom $\nu$ is computed as follows:
$$ \nu = \frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{\frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{\left(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\right)^2}{n_2 - 1}}$$
- Note that we take the floor of $\nu$ 

### Example
- $n_1 =12$, $\bar{x}_1 = 85$, $s_1 = 4$
- $n_2 = 10$, $\bar{x}_2 = 81$, $s_2 = 5$ 
- Can we conclude at the 0.05 level of significance that 1 exceeds 2 by more than 2 units. Assume the populations to be approximately normal with equal variances: 

**Solution**:
- Find the null hypothesis $d_0 = 2$ 
- We need to find the pooled variance $s_p^2$ since we are assuming equal variances 
$$ s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} = \frac{(11)(4)^2 + (9)(5)^2}{20} = 20.05$$

- We use $v = n_1 + n_2 - 2 = 20$ to find the degrees of freedom

- The critical region is $t > 1.725$ which is equal to $t = t_{v=20, \alpha = 0.05} = 1.725$

- Now, we have that our test statistic is 

$t = 1.04$ and $P(t_{v=20} > 1.04) = 0.16 > \alpha = 0.05$
- We fail to reject H_o there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the 1 is more than 2 by more than 2 units


## Testing of Two means with Paired Observations
- When data are in the form of paired observation (before and after), we compute the difference between the paired observations: Assuming the observations are normal, the hypothesis test is the same as above:
$$ H_0: \mu_d = d_0$$
- The test statsitic for this hypotehsis is: 
$$ t = \frac{\bar{d} - d_0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t_{n-1}$$

- The critical regions for this hypothesis are constructed using the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom


### Example
- $\bar{d} = 9.848$, $s_d = 18.474$, $n = 15$
- Assuming that the population is normal, test at the 0.05 level of significance whether the samples are alterted: 

**Solution**:
- We have that the null hypothesis is $\mu_{\bar{d}} = 0$ and the alternative hypothesis is $\mu_{\bar{d}} \neq 0$
- The test statistic is 
$$ t = \frac{9.848 - 0}{\frac{18.474}{\sqrt{15}}} = 2.065$$
- The critical region is two sided, centered around 0, so we need to find both sides. we know that  $ t_{14, 0.025} = 2.145 \implies P(t > 2.065 = \frac{\text{p value}}{2}) $  So the total p-value is $2 P(t > 2.065) = 2 \times 0.03$  
Since we know that this is greater than alpha, we reject the null 
0.06 > 0.05


- The critical region is two sided and we have that $t_{14, 0.025} = 2.145$ and
