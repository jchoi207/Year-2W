## Tolerance limits for normal distributions

-   Tolerance limits define a range within which we expect a certain
    proportion of the population to fall. Unlike confidence or
    prediction intervals, tolerance limits do not shrink with increasing
    sample size but are intended to encompass a fixed percentage of the
    population.

***Definition:***\
\
For a normal distribution of measurements with unknown mean $\mu$ and
unknown standard deviation $\sigma$ tolerance limits are given by
$\bar{x} \pm ks$, where $k$ is determined such that one can assert with
$100(1-\gamma)\%$ confidence that the limits contain at least proportion
$1-\alpha$ of the measurements

Given

-   IID observations $x_1, ..., x_n$

-   The sample mean $\bar{x}$ and sample variance $S^2$

-   The tolerance interval is then expressed as $\bar{x} \pm ks$

### Example

-   $1.01, 0.97,1.03,1.04,0.99,0.98,0.99,1.01,1.03$

-   $n= 9$, $\bar{x} = 1.0056$ and $s= 0.0246$

-   Calculate 99% confidence interval on mean

    -   **Solution:** find $t_{0.005,8} = 3.355$:
        $$\bar{x} \pm t_{0.005}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.0056 \pm 0.0275$$

-   Calculate 99% prediction interval:

    -   **Solution:** $t_{0.005,8} = 3.355$:
        $$\bar{x} \pm t_{0.005} s \sqrt{1+ \frac{1}{9}} = 1.0056 \pm(3.355)(0.0246)\sqrt{1+1/9}$$

-   Calculate the 99% tolerance limit that will contain 95% of the
    population

    -   **Solution:** thus, we know that $1-\gamma = 0.99$ and
        $1 -\alpha = 0.95$

    -   From the table, we find that for $n=9$ $k = 4.550$, thus
        $$\bar{x} \pm ks = 1.0056 \pm (4.550)(0.0246)$$

    -   Thus, we are 99% confident that 95% of the population will have
        measurements between 0.8937 and 1.1175

## Comparison of various Interval Estimates

-   **Confidence intervals:**

    -   Based on IID observation $x_1, ... ,x_n$

    -   There is a $100(1-\alpha) \%$ chance that the true mean $\mu$ is
        within the interval around $\bar{x}$

    -   z-scores: if $\sigma$ is known and $n$ is large (or if $X_i$ is
        normal and $\sigma$ known)

    -   t-scores: if $s$ is known

-   **Prediction Interval**

    -   Based on IID observation $x_1, ... ,x_n$

    -   A $100(1-\alpha) \%$ chance that the next observation will fall
        within the interval around $\bar{x}$

    -   z-scores: same as above

    -   t-scores: same as above

-   **Tolerance Limits (interval)**

    -   Based on IID observation $x_1, ... ,x_n$

    -   Assert with $100(1-\gamma)\%$ confidence that $100(1-\alpha)\%$
        of all future measurements are expected to fall within the
        interval $\bar{x} \pm ks$

    -   Use **statistical tables** to find the value of $k$

## Two Samples with Known but different Distributions

-   Sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$

-   Sample means $\bar{X_1}$ and $\bar{X}_2$

-   Estimating the difference between two means:

    -   The point estimate for $\mu_1 - \mu_2: \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$

    -   Sample distribution of the difference is approximately normal

    -   Mean: $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

    -   Variance: $\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}$

-   $$Z = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}}}$$

-   Thus, we can find a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for
    $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, which is given by
    $$(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} < \mu_1 - \mu_2 < (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) + z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$$

### Example

-   $n_1 =50$, $n_2 = 75$

-   $\bar{x}_1 = 36$, $\bar{x}_2 =42$

-   $\sigma_1 = 6$, $\sigma_2 = 8$

-   Find a 96% confidence interval on $\mu_2 - \mu_1$

-   **Solution:** we want to find 96%, so we take $\alpha = 0.04$. We
    also are given the population ST. dev, so we look for z-scores,
    specifically $z_{0.02}=+2.05$, thus we simply apply the formula:
    $$\mu_2 - \mu_1 = 42 - 36 \pm 2.05 \sqrt{\frac{6^2}{50} + \frac{8^2}{75}}$$

## Two Samples with Unknown but equal Variance 

-   assume $\sigma_1 = \sigma_2$ but are both unknown

-   Sample sizes $n_1, n_2 < 30$ are normally distributed

-   We don't know the population variance, so we use $T$ distribution

-   $$T = \frac{(\bar{X_1} - \bar{X_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{S_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}$$

-   Where $S_P^2$ is the sample size weighted average of $S_1^2$ and
    $S_2^2$. Note that we use the pooled variance because it is assumed
    that the variances are to be similar in value:
    $$S_p^2 = \frac{(n_1-1)S_1^2 + (n_2 -1)S^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}$$

-   This distribution has $v=n_1 +n_2 - 2$ degrees of freedom

-   The two-sided confidence interval is of the form

-   $$(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - t_{\alpha/2} s_p \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}) < \mu_1 - \mu_2 < (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) + t_{\alpha/2} s_p \sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2})$$

-   Once again, intuitively, we are just finding the t-values that give
    us our desired confidence level with a given number of degrees of
    freedom. From there, we can use the t-values to transform back into
    our original coordinate system.

### Example

-   $n_1 =12$, $n_2 =10$

-   $\bar{x}_1 = 3.11$, $\bar{x}_2 = 2.04$

-   $s_1 = 0.771$, $s_2 = 0.448$

-   Find a 90% confidence interval for the mean $\mu_1 -\mu_2$

-   **Solution:** calculate the sample size weighted variance $= 0.417$.
    Next, we find that the degrees of freedom are $v = 12 + 10 - 2 =20$.
    Now we note that $1- \alpha = 0.9$, so $\alpha = 0.1$ and we look
    for values of $\pm t_{0.05, 20} = \pm 1.725$, and we plug, NOTE that
    we use $s_p$
    $$\mu_1 - \mu_2 = (3.11 - 2.04) \pm (1.725)(\sqrt{0.417})\sqrt{1/12 +1/10}$$

## Two Samples with Unknown but different Variance 

-   $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are **both unknown and unlikely to be
    equal**

-   Test statistic
    $$T' = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2) }{ \sqrt{S_1^2/n_1 + S_2^2/n_2}}$$

-   Thus the interval with $1(1-\alpha)\%$ certainty is
    $$(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 - t_{\alpha/2, v} \sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s^2_2,n_2}) < \mu_1 - \mu_2 < (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 + t_{\alpha/2, v} \sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s^2_2,n_2})$$

-   **Note that we approximate the degrees of freedom as** (look at
    figure)
    $$v \approx \frac{(S_1^2/n_1 + S_2^2/n_2)^2}{\frac{(S_1^2/n_1)^2}{n_1-1} + \frac{(S_2^2/n_2)^2}{n_2-2}}$$

    width="0.5\\linewidth"}

-   $$P(-t_{\alpha/2} \leq T' \leq t_{\alpha/2}) \approx 1 - \alpha$$

### Example

-   $\bar{x}_1 = 3.84$, $\bar{x}_2 = 1.49$

-   $s_1 = 3.07$, $s_2 = 0.80$

-   $n_1 = 15$, $n_2 =12$

-   Find the 95% confidence interval for $\mu_1-\mu_2$

-   **Solution:** Since the sample standard deviations are not similar,
    we must approximate the degrees of freedom and then use the
    t-distribution: $v=16.316 = 16$, now, we use the t-distribution
    tables to find $t_{0.025, 16}$ and plug
    $$(\mu_1-\mu_2) = (3.94 - 1.49) \pm 2.120 \sqrt{3.07^2/15 + 0.80^2/12}$$
