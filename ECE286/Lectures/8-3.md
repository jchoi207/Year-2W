### Note on Z-scores

-   $z_{0.025} = 1.96$

-   having $\beta < 0.5$, we know that we are looking for some $z_\beta$
    such that the probability of our random variable $z$ is less than
    $z_\beta$ is equal to $\beta$

-   Similarly, $P(z > z_\beta) = \beta$ as the distribution is symmetric

-   So we will have $-z_{0.025}$ and $z_{0.025}$

-   By looking at the table, we have the left tail (cumulative), so
    technically $z_{0.025} = z_{0.975}$

**One-sided confidence intervals**

-   $n, \bar{x}, \sigma^2$

-   For a one-sided confidence interval:
    $$1-\alpha = P(Z \leq z_{\alpha})$$

-   Where $z_\alpha = - \Phi^{-1}(\alpha)$

-   The upper bound for the one-sided interval (LEFT):
    $$\bar{X_U} = \bar{x} + z_c \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

-   The lower bound for the one-sided interval (RIGHT)
    $$\bar{X}_L = \bar{x} - z_c \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

### Example

-   $n = 25$

-   $\sigma^2 = 4$

-   $\bar{x} = 6.2$

-   give a 95 % bound for the mean reaction time

    -   So we need to find some $z_c$ s.t. $P(Z \leq z_c) = 0.95$

    -   This value is equal to 1.645. **Since this is an upper bound,
        the value of $z_c$ should be positive**

-   $$\bar{X}_U = 6.2 + 1.645 \times \frac{2}{5}$$

**Confidence intervals for the mean with unknown standard deviation**

-   When we don't know $\sigma$, the population standard deviation

-   **When $\sigma$ is unknown and the distribution is normal, use the
    t-distribution**

-   We use t distribution

-   The statistic is $T = \frac{\bar{X} -\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}$ with $v= n-1$
    degrees of freedom

-   **Confidence interval** of a two-sided confidence interval with
    confidence level $1- \alpha$

-   $$1-\alpha = P(-t_{\alpha/2} \leq T \leq t_{\alpha/2})$$

-   $$P(\bar{X} - t_{\alpha/2} \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{X} + t_{\alpha/2} \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}})$$

-   Where $S$ is the sample variance

### Example

-   The contents of seven similar containers of sulfuric acid are
    $9.8., 10.2, 10.4, 9.8, 10.0, 10.2, 9.6$ Find a 95% confidence
    interval for the mean contents of all such containers, assuming an
    approximately normal distribution

-   Calculate $S$

-   $v =6$ degrees of freedom (n=7-1 )

-   Use t-distribution to find $t_{\alpha/2}$ s.t.
    $P(T \leq t_{0.025,6})$

-   $-t_{0.025, 6} = -2.447$

### Example

-   Sample is $9.8,10.2,10.4,9.8,10.0,10.2,9.6$

-   Find a $95\%$ confidence interval for the mean, assuming normal
    distribution

-   **Solution:** population variance is not given and population is
    normal, so **T-distribution**

-   $\bar{x} = 10$,
    $s = \frac{1}{7-6} \sum_{i=1}^{7}(\bar{x} - x_i)^2 \rightarrow \sqrt{s} = 0.283$

-   Now, we look for t-values: $t_{0.025, 6}$ with 6 degrees of freedom
    and we get $2.447$, thus our confidence level is
    $10.0 - 2.447 (\frac{0.283}{\sqrt{7}}) \leq \mu \leq 10.0 + 2.447 (\frac{0.283}{\sqrt{7}})$

-   Again, all we are doing is finding t-values for $95\%$ confidence
    levels in the t-domain. Once we see this confidence interval, we
    return to our original coordinates, using these t-values to compute
    the interval that produces the same $95\%$ confidence interval.

## Standard Error

-   When we draw samples $X_1, ..., X_n$ from a distribution with
    unknown mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

-   The standard deviation of $Z$, which we term the **standard error**,
    is approximately $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$

## Prediction **Intervals** with Known Variance

-   Say we have normal samples, with population variance $\sigma^2$ and
    some sample mean $\bar{X}$

-   For a new observation $X_o$ (prediction), we use $\bar{X}$ as a
    point estimate and we define
    $$Z = \frac{X_o - \bar{X}}{\sigma \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}}$$

-   Then the confidence interval for our prediction is
    $$\bar{x} - z_{\alpha/2} \sigma \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}} \leq x_o \leq \bar{x} + z_{\alpha/2} \sigma \sqrt{1+ \frac{1}{n}}$$

### Example

-   $n=50$, $\bar{x} = 257300$, $\sigma =25000$

-   Find $95\%$ prediction interval for the **next point**

-   **Solution**: we are given $\sigma$ and $n > 30$, so we use the z
    distribution; however, we must use the above z-score for our
    prediction

-   $$257300 \pm (1.96)(25000)\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{50}}$$
