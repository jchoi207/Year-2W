## Confidence Intervals for Paired Observations

-   If $\bar{d}$ and $s_D$ are the mean and standard deviation of the
    normally distributed differences of $n$ pairs of measurements, a
    $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\mu_D = \mu_1 -\mu_2$ is
    $$\bar{d} - t_{\alpha/2} \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu_D < \bar{d} + t_{\alpha/2} \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}$$

-   where $t_{\alpha/2}$ is the t-value with $v = n-1$ degrees of
    freedom, leaving an area of $\alpha/2$ on the right

-   Intuition: imagine two RV, $X,Y$ with samples $x_1, ...$ and
    $y_1...$, then, the difference $d_1 = x_1 - y_1$

### Example

-   The point estimate of $\mu_D$ is $\bar{d} = -0.87$ with
    $s_d = 2.9773$ and $n=20$

-   We wish to find a 95% confidence interval for
    $\mu_D  = \mu_1 - \mu_2$

-   **Solution:**

    -   We find t-value $t_{0.025, 19}$ and then plug
        $$\mu_D = -0.87 \pm (2.093) \frac{2.9773}{\sqrt{20}})$$

## Analysis and Application

-   Comparison of two related samples with one-to-one correspondence
    (e.g. comparing efficiency before and after process improvements)

-   Let $(X_i, Y_i)$ represent the paired samples for $i = 1,...,n$. Let
    us assume that $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are normally distributed with means
    $\mu_X, \mu_Y$ and $\sigma_X, \sigma_Y$. By defining the difference
    between the i-th pair as $D_i = X_i - Y_i$, then the variance of
    $D_i$ is
    $$\text{Var}(D_i) = \sigma^2_X + \sigma^2_Y - 2 \text{Cov}(X_i, Y_i)$$

-   Thus, the variance of $D$ is
    $$S^2_D = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (D_i - \bar{D})^2$$

## Confidence Intervals Estimating a Proportion (single sample)

-   A point estimator of the proportion $p$ in a binomial experiment is
    given by the statistic $\hat{P} = X/n$, where $X$ represents the
    number of successes in $n$ trials. Therefore, the sample proportion
    $\hat{p} = x/n$ will be used as the point estimate of the parameter
    $p$

-   By the CLT, for $N$ sufficiently large, $\hat{P}$ is normally
    distributed with mean $\mu_{\hat{P}} = p$ and variance
    $\sigma^2_{\hat{P}} = \frac{pq}{n}$ and
    $$P(-z_{\alpha/2} < \frac{\hat{p} -p}{\sqrt{pq/n}}<z_{\alpha/2}) = 1 - \alpha$$

-   For $n$ large,
    $$1 - \alpha = P(\hat{p} - z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p}}{n})}\leq p \leq \hat{p} + z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p}}{n})})$$

### Example

-   $n = 500$, $r=340$ subscribe to HBO, find a $95\%$ confidence
    interval for the actual proportion of families that subscribe to HBO

-   **Solution:** $1-\alpha = 0.95\rightarrow \alpha = 0.05$. We can use
    $\hat{p}= x/n$ as the point estimate of $p$ (the real value of a
    success). In this case $\hat{p} = 340/500$. Now, we can use the
    standard normal to find $\pm z_{0.05/2}$ and from there we can
    transform $$0.6391 < p < 0.7209$$

## Choice of Sample Size

-   Suppose we want $100(1-\alpha_\%$ confidence that the estimator is
    less than $\delta$

-   $$\delta = z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$

-   $$n = \frac{z^2_{\alpha/2} \hat{p} (1-\hat{p})}{\delta^2}$$

-   **Safe lower bound** $n \geq \frac{z^2_{\alpha/2}}{4\delta^2}$

-   This is used when we have yet to approximate $p$ with a point
    estimate.

-   In practice, first computing $\hat{p}$ and then using
    $n = \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2\hat{p}\hat{q}}{\delta^2}$ will lead to a
    smaller $n$ than if we hadn't computed $\hat{p}$

### Example

-   How large of sample $n$ is needed if we want a $95\%$ confidence
    interval that our estimate of $p$ in the previous example is within
    0.02 of the true value

-   **Solution:** $\delta = 0.02$, $\hat{p} = 0.68$ and
    $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$
    $$n = \frac{1.96^2 (0.68)(1-0.68)}{0.02^2} = 2090$$
