## Quantiles and Probability Plots

**Quantiles**

-   Definition: a quantile of a sample, $q(f)$ is a **value** for which
    a specific fraction $f$ of the data values is less than or equal to
    $q(f)$:

-   For example, the median is $q(0.5)$ the 75th percentile is $q(0.75)$

**Quantile Plot**

-   A quantile plot displays the data values **against the proportion of
    observation** they exceed (quantile v fraction)

-   The fraction for the $i$-th data point is
    $f_i = \frac{i - \frac{3}{8}}{n + \frac{1}{4}}$

-   This plot visualizes the sample's empirical distribution function

    -   Flat areas indicate clusters

    
    -   Steep areas are sparse

-   Note that if you rotate the quantile plot, you get an
    **approximation for the CDF**

-   To sketch a quantile plot:

    -   Arrange the sample in increasing order, denoted as
        $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$

    -   For each data point indexed by $i$ (where $i = 1,..., n)$, plot
        the pair

-   Example: ${28,28,29.2,...}$

    -   Calculate, $f_1$ and $f_2$, $f(3)$

-   Example: $-2, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3,3, 4,6$

    -   Plot $q(f)$ against $f$

    -   For each $f$ value of the current point, plot the value of the
        function

    -   Thus, the three 3s, take values of $f = 5,6,7$ , and
        $f(5,6,7) = 3$

**Relation of quantile function to CDF**

-   Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with probability density
    function $f(x)$ and cumulative distribution function $F(x)$

-   $F(x)$ represents the probability that an outcome is less than or
    equal to x

-   Consider a \"theoretical\" quantile $q(f) =x$, such that a fraction
    $f$ of the data is less than or equal to $x$

-   $q = F^{-1}$ informally,

**Normal Quantile-Quantile Plots**

-   A normal quantile quantile Q-Q plot is a graphical tool to compare a
    sample's distribution to a normal distribution.

-   The plot displays the ordered sample values against the theoretical
    quantiles that are found from a normal distribution with mean and
    standard deviation, $\mu, \sigma$

-   $$q_{\mu, \sigma}(f) = \mu + \sigma{4.91[f^{0.14} -(1-f)^{0.14}]} \rightarrow y = mx + b$$

-   For a standard normal curve:
    $$q(f) ={4.91[f^{0.14} -(1-f)^{0.14}]} \rightarrow y = mx + b$$

-   So we essentially linearity the quantiles that associate with the
    normal distribution

-   Note that the above is an approximation

-   This is derived from the Normal CDF, and $q(f) = \Phi^{-1}(f)$

**usage**

-   A nearly straight line pattern indicates that the sample
    distribution is approximately normal

**interpretation**

-   In a normal sample distribution, the quantile plot would look sparse
    at either end of the sample values (top and bottom), but near the
    center, it would seem most dense

    -   At either end, the frequency of values far away from the mean is
        less

    -   Near the center, most of the values will be concentrated around
        the mean

**plotting a normal q-q plot**

-   Plot $$(q_{0,1}(f_i), x_i)$$

-   Where $q_{0,1}(f_i)$ is the standard normal linearized approximation
    $$q(f) ={4.91[f^{0.14} -(1-f)^{0.14}]} \rightarrow y = mx + b$$

## Discussion on Central Limit Theorem and the F-distribution

-   CLT: $\sigma$ is known

-   F, T distributions: $\sigma$ is unknown
